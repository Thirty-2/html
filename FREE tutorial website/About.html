                    PCD Httls opened its doors in 2017 in the vibrant city of Bangkok, Thailand. Founded by a group of friends - Prapha, Chet, and Dan - who shared a passion for hospitality and innovation. The hotel's name combines their initials with "Httls" for hospitality. Starting with 30 rooms, PCD Httls quickly became a hotspot for travelers seeking a unique experience. The hotel's rooftop bar, featuring live music and stunning city views, was an instant hit. In 2019, PCD Httls expanded to 60 rooms and introduced a sustainable tourism program, supporting local artisans and community projects. Today, it remains a beloved destination for travelers seeking adventure, comfort, and connection.</p>
                <p>PCD Httls' success led to collaborations with local artists, showcasing their work throughout the hotel. The hotel's restaurant, "Taste of Thailand," serves authentic dishes made with locally sourced ingredients.
