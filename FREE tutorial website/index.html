Starting with 20 rooms, PCD Httls quickly gained popularity for its modern amenities, eco-friendly practices, and personalized service. By 2020, the hotel expanded to 50 rooms and received several awards for sustainability, customer service, and innovative design, solidifying its reputation as a premier boutique hotel.</p>
